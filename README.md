What Is Global Human Being (GHB)?

GHB is a token that aims to produce passive income for our token holders by developing various profit-generating businesses.

As a token, the Global Human Being team will implement  GHB as a form of payment for all our eCommerce stores that are operated directly by our team. Also,  we will be constantly seeking partnerships to expand the number of online businesses that accept  GHB as payment for goods and services throughout the world.

WHAT MAKES GHB UNIQUE?

Because it is only a prosperity-based project and we have kept 06% of the total supply of tokens that's only will be distributed all over the world and no difference with races of global humans being.

The GHB token is designed to ensure that owners can also participate in the operation of the project network and keep full service globally for human beings. Because of this, those who hold the GHB have the right to give suggestions and opinions to the management for many coming future development projects for the Human Being of the world.
