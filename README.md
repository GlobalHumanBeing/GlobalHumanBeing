What is Global Human Being (GHB) ?

COMMUNITY PROSPERITY PROJECT.

GHB crypto project believes in real profits and community development.

We are on a mission to make a significant social impact by transferring a wide range of benefits to the community.

*** - CHARITY FOR GHB - ***

GHBâ€™s management decided that we must keep a 15% charity token from the Total Supply of GHB.    GHBâ€™s goal is to raise money in order to help people who are sick or very poor, or who have a disability, so together we all raise money for our beloved world.

*** - EDUCATION FOR GHB - ***

GHBâ€™s goal is to educate every child in the world because every child has the right to go to school and learn, regardless of who they are, where they live, or how much money their family has or not to educate their lovely child so help them.

*** - PROSPERITY FOR GHB - ***

Poverty remains one of the most inflexible barriers, with children from the poorest households almost five times more likely to be out of primary school than those from the richest. It is very harmful to us that more than 29m children are out of school due to lack of money.
